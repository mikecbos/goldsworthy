# Goldsworthy's Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics: Unsupervised ML Exploration

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze Graeme Goldsworthy's gospel-centered hermeneutical framework from his published book.

## Project Overview

Rather than creating another Bible web application, this project focuses on using machine learning to discover and analyze patterns within Goldsworthy's theological framework. By applying natural language processing and unsupervised learning to Goldsworthy's texts, we aim to:

1. Discover latent themes and connections across his works
2. Identify how his gospel-centered approach manifests linguistically
3. Create visual representations of his theological concepts and their relationships
4. Uncover the deeper cosmic framework where God's glory, wisdom, and purpose are revealed through the biblical narrative

## Methodological Approach

This project employs several unsupervised learning techniques:

### Topic Modeling
- Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify underlying theological themes
- Discover how concepts cluster across different works
- Track the development of key themes across Goldsworthy's corpus

### Semantic Network Analysis
- Create knowledge graphs connecting theological concepts
- Visualize relationships between hermeneutical principles
- Identify central nodes in Goldsworthy's theological framework

### Concept Clustering
- Group related theological terms based on their contextual usage
- Identify semantic relationships beyond explicit connections
- Map the theological vocabulary that defines his approach

### Linguistic Pattern Recognition
- Identify distinctive language patterns associated with gospel-centered interpretation
- Analyze how Goldsworthy articulates connections between Old and New Testaments
- Examine linguistic markers of Christ-centered readings

## Research Questions

This exploratory analysis seeks to answer:

1. How does Goldsworthy's hermeneutical framework extend beyond simple Christ typology?
2. What are the linguistic patterns associated with his gospel-centered reading strategy?
3. How does the concept of God's glory manifest across different theological domains?
4. What semantic relationships exist between key theological concepts in his framework?
5. How might machine learning reveal connections not immediately obvious through traditional reading?

## Current Status

This project is in the exploratory data analysis phase. We are currently:
- Processing and cleaning Goldsworthy's texts
- Implementing initial topic modeling
- Developing visualization approaches for theological concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Natural Language Processing: spaCy, NLTK
- Topic Modeling: Gensim, scikit-learn
- Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe
- Visualization: NetworkX, pyLDAvis, Matplotlib
- Development Environment: Jupyter Notebooks

### Getting Started (For Developers)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/goldsworthy-analysis.git
cd goldsworthy-analysis

# Create and activate a conda environment
conda create -n goldsworthy-env python=3.9
conda activate goldsworthy-env

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch Jupyter to explore notebooks
jupyter lab
```

## Future Directions

While the current focus is on exploratory analysis using unsupervised learning, future directions may include:

1. Developing supervised models based on initial findings
2. Creating a knowledge graph of Goldsworthy's theological framework
3. Applying findings to biblical text analysis
4. Comparing Goldsworthy's approach with other hermeneutical frameworks

## Contribution

This is an open research project. Contributions from both theological scholars and ML practitioners are welcome. Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines.
